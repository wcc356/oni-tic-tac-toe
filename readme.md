A HTML game with Phaser
now you can play this game at 
https://wcc356.github.io/oni-tic-tac-toe/

Oni(鬼) in japanese language is like a monster or orc. Use you chess to control the castle!

Rules: 
1. There's 3 diffrent size of oni, each has 2 chess respectively. The bigger one can cover the smaller and make the covered can't move
2. You can move one of your chess on the board in your turn, but can leave the board after enter the board
3. Just like a tic-toc-toe, winner is the first who make a line 
(but when you move and try to make a line, the covered chess making the line will faster than you to become the winner)

規則:
1. 有三種大小的棋子各兩個 大的可以蓋住小的，被蓋住的棋子無法移動
2. 輪到你時可以自由移動一個棋子，但如果已經放入棋盤上的棋子就必須一直待再棋盤上
3. 勝利條件就是井字遊戲(OOXX)，連成一直線就贏了(但如果你動作後對方先連成一線就算對方贏，就算你也連線了)

未來預計會
1. 新增那些日本古城的介紹，我不是亂選的==
2. 會有規則的演示和小提示
3. 連線對戰
