===============
>##### you can play this game at https://wcc356.github.io/oni-tic-tac-toe
>##### Language: Typescript  
>##### Framework: Phaser 

Introduction
---------------
> **Oni(鬼)** in japanese language is like an ogre. 
> Use your chess(oni) to control the castles! 
> This is a complicated tic-tac-toe!


## Rules:
> There's 3 different sizes of oni, each has 2 chess pieces. 
>
> The bigger one can cover the smaller and make the covered can't move
>
> You can move one of your chess on the board in your turn, 
>
> but can leave the board after enter the board
>
>Just like a tic-tac-toe, winner is the first who make a line (but when you move and try to make a line, the covered chess making the line will faster than you to become the winner)

## future target:
>1. introduce the ancient Japanese castle, their location is not located randomly
>
>2. make the tutorial more exquisite, now I just make a video to demo that, I hope I can just use the code to represent the tutorial
>
>3. multiple player connecting, I am learning but still not on site

## 規則:

>有三種大小的棋子各兩個 大的可以蓋住小的，被蓋住的棋子無法移動
>
>輪到你時可以自由移動一個棋子，但如果已經放入棋盤上的棋子就必須一直待再棋盤上
>
>勝利條件就是井字遊戲(OOXX)，連成一直線就贏了(但如果你動作後在下面對方先連成一線就算你連線了也算對方贏，)

## 未來預計:
>
> 1.新增那些日本古城的介紹
>
> 2.會有規則的演示和小提示
>
> 3.連線對戰
